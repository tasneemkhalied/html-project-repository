 Artificial intelligence (A.I.) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
 programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine
 that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.The ideal
 characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the 
 best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which
 refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being
 assisted by humans.

The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied 
to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare
 industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures
 in the operating room.Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include
 computers that play chess and self-driving cars Each of these machines must weigh the 
 consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result.

Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong.
 Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job.
 Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal
 assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question,
 it answers it for you. Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that 
 carry on the tasks considered to be human-like.These tend to be more complex and
 complicated systems.
