There 4 types of the artificial intelligence they are :</font></p>

<h2 style="font-size:33px;"> Reactive Machines:</h2>

Reactive Machines perform basic operations. This level of A.I. is the simplest.
 These types react to some input with some output. There is no learning that occurs.
 This is the first stage to any A.I. system. A machine learning that takes a human face
 as input and outputs a box around the face to identify it as a face
 is a simple,reactive machine.The model stores no inputs, it performs no learning

<h2 style="font-size:33px;"> Limited Memory: </h2>
 
 <p  style="text-align:left; width: 900px; "> 
 <font size="5" face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue">
 <img src="limited memory.png" alt="types" style="width: 225px; height: 150px; float: right; padding-left:20" >
 Limited memory types refer to an A.I.’s ability to store previous data and/or predictions,
 using that data to make better predictions. With Limited Memory, machine learning 
 architecture becomes a little more complex. Every machine learning model requires limited
 memory to be created, but the model can get deployed as a reactive machine type

<h2 style="font-size:33px;" > Theory of Mind: </h2>
 
 <p style="text-align:left; width: 900;" > 
 <font size="5" face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue">
<img src="theory of mind.png"alt="types" style="width: 200px; height: 175px; float:right; padding-left:20; padding-bottom:10">
 The ability of the human mind to attribute mental states to others - is a key component 
 of human cognition.The same capability of inferring human mental states is a prerequisite
 for artificial intelligence (A.I.) to be integrated into human society.
 We have yet to reach Theory of Mind artificial intelligence types. These are only in their
 beginning phases and can be seen in things like self-driving cars. 
 In this type of A.I., A.I.begins to interact with the thoughts and emotions of humans.

<h2 style="font-size:33px;"> Self Aware: </h2>
 
 <p size="text-align:left; width: 900;">
 <font size="5" face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue">
 <img src="self aware.png"alt="types" style="width: 225px; height: 150px; float:right; padding-left:20" >
 Finally, in some distant future, perhaps A.I. achieves nirvana. It becomes self-aware.
 This kind of A.I. exists only in story, and, as stories often do, instills both immense
 amounts of hope and fear into audiences. A self-aware intelligence beyond the human has
 an independent intelligence, and likely, people will have to negotiate terms with the 
 entity it created. What happens, good or bad, is anyone’s guess.
